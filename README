Conway's Game of Life

Background
==========
I find the best way to learn a language is with a specific project in mind, so
after learning the basics of Processing (before actually learning Java) I
decided to delve a little deeper with this project. I do not claim it's perfect
or even that great an implementation, but it works as best I can tell. Thus, I
give you Conway's Game of Life.

Usage
=====
This sketch was started in Processing 1.5.1, so that version and above should
work just fine. As with all Processing sketches, just open in the IDE and press
play.

Clicking will place a cell on the grid. Click a living cell again to remove it.
The Game of Life is a zero-player game, so press start, sit back, and watch.
